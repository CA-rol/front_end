  <h2>Goal and Habit<h2>
  <h6>A goal is a short term oriented mindset.Its like an errand that we have forced our minds to perform.We tend to dislike activities that make us tired and worn out.Thats how i view a goal.We are not mentally connected to the activity, we just it in order to do away with it or rather to be on the safer side.Take forexample maybe you want to hit the gym because you want you to loose 20bls.You will be waking up everyday to go to the gym to do the exercise but on the third day your whole body will not be corperating.So the chances of you not going to the gym the next is every high,simply because you are not attached to your goal.Lets stop doing things  because they need to be done,lets do things because we want to do them and enjoy doing them. </h6>

  <h6>A habit is a frequently repeated behaviour that we tend to do even without our conscience ,we find our selves doing it without being told because its instilled in us.Some thing with a habit is that our minds know what is that habit is.Its registerd in the head and it becomes part you.With a habit even if its something you dont like doing if just make it a habit ,it will flow .Thats the difffrence between agoal and a habit.Lets make habits and not goals.Goods habits also have returns,some habits return are good and tent to help .So choose a habit whose return is going to build you.</h6>

<h1>TECHNOLOGY<h1>

Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s. The development of the style is often attributed to a so-called "second wave" of American producers associated with Detroit techno. According to Derrick May, "while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit".[5] This younger generation included producers such as Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks. The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism.

Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too "ravey", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that "it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground."[4]

The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as "a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound."[6] Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too "arty".</p>
